GaPSE (Galaxy Power Spectrum Estimator) is a software for cosmological computations written in the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org).

It's currently under construction! 

## Brief description

Measurements of the clustering of galaxies in Fourier space, at low wavenumbers, offer a window into the early Universe via the possible presence of scale dependent bias generated by Primordial Non Gaussianities [[1]](#1) [[2]](#1).
On such large scales, a Newtonian treatment of density of density perturbations might not be sufficient to describe the measurements, and a fully relativistic calculation should be employed.

Given the matter Power Spectrum (PS) at redshift $z=0$ and the background quantities for the Universe considered (both read from [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) outputs), this program can compute:

- all the 16 TPCFs arising from the Luminosity Distance (LD) perturbations (see Eq.(2.48) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- all the 25 TPCFs concerning the relativistic Galaxy Number Counts (GNC)  (see Eq.(2.52) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- all the 20 cross correlations between GNC and LD (and their 20 counterparts LD cross GNC) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- the PS multipoles of all of them (based on the Yamamoto estimator).

- the Doppler and matter TPCFs in the plane-parallel approximation.

All these calculations can be performed both with and without a survey window function. The code implements also a toy-survey with azymuthal symmetry.

This project, and the analytical expressions used for the TPCFs, are based on the article of Emanuele Castorina and Enea Di Dio [[3]](#1). 

## Installation

The simplest way to install this software is cloning the repository where it is built in. Run in the command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmofico97/GaPSE
```
or download the source code from the github repository https://github.com/cosmofico97/GaPSE.

## Execution

The only mandatory instrument to run the code is a Julia REPL with version ≥ 1.7. 
You can write whatever instructions inside the file `GaPSE-exe.jl` and then run it
in the command line:

```bash
     $ julia GaPSE.jl
```

However, the most confortable way to use it is through the Jupyter Notebooks: some `.ipynb` is already provided in the same named directory, and we encourage you to follow the `TUTORIAL.ipynb` file first. The basic structure of the program and the most important functions are there presented.
