GaPSE (Galaxy Power Spectrum Estimator) is a software for cosmological computations written in the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org).

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a work-in-progress project! As a consequence, currently in this pre-release:
- it is possible to compute the power spectrum/correlation function multipoles with L=1,2,3,... of the effects we'll show next, but 2 effects among the Galaxy Number Counts multipoles (Newton-Lensing and Lensing-Newton) converge very slowly, so their computation is not still 100% ready. However, the monopole (L=0) computations do not have any problem with `quad`, and even the GNC sum for higher order multipoles is not affected;
- The Power Spectrum computations with `:twofast` do not work properly, you should always prefer `:fftog`. However, due to the fact that with `:fftlog` you must specify manually the bias parameter, the Power Spectra of a whole group of terms creates FFT oscillations in the smallest ones. The leading ones and the sum are not however affected.  
- the code functions are well documented; check the github pages website https://foglienimatteo.github.io/GaPSE.jl/stable if you can't see correctly the analytical expressions written in the docstrings; 
- few people used this code, so bugs are behind the corner; do not hesitate to raise the finger to point out them (see in the [How to report bugs, suggest improvements and/or contribute](#how-to-report-bugs-suggest-improvements-andor-contribute) section below)!

## Brief description

Measurements of the clustering of galaxies in Fourier space, at low wavenumbers, offer a window into the early Universe via the possible presence of scale dependent bias generated by Primordial Non Gaussianities [[1]](#1) [[2]](#1).
On such large scales, a Newtonian treatment of density of density perturbations might not be sufficient to describe the measurements, and a fully relativistic calculation should be employed.

Given the matter Power Spectrum (PS) at redshift $z=0$ and the background quantities for the Universe considered (both read from [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) outputs), this program can compute:

- all the 16 TPCFs arising from the Luminosity Distance (LD) perturbations (see Eq.(2.48) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- all the 25 TPCFs concerning the relativistic Galaxy Number Counts (GNC)  (see Eq.(2.52) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- all the 20 cross correlations between GNC and LD (and their 20 counterparts LD cross GNC) for an arbitrary multipole order.

- the PS multipoles of all of them (based on the Yamamoto estimator).

- the Doppler and matter TPCFs in the plane-parallel approximation.

All these calculations can be performed both with and without a survey window function. The code implements also a toy-survey with azymuthal symmetry.

This project, and the analytical expressions used for the TPCFs, are based on the article of Emanuele Castorina and Enea Di Dio [[3]](#1). 

## Installation and Usage

Currently, this package is not in the Julia package registries. 
There are two main ways to install and use GaPSE on your local machine:
-  the traditional way: you clone this gitrepo locally and you install the librarires that GaPSE needs in a suited Julia enviroment; it requires a compatible Julia version â‰¥1.8;
-  using a Docker container (experimental): you pull and run the GaPSE container; it requires a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installation.


### traditional way: Installation

Assuming that you have already installed a coompatible Julia version, the simplest way to install this software is then the following:

- in the terminal, go to the directory where you want to install this package;
  
- clone this repository with Git
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/foglienimatteo/GaPSE.jl
  ```
  or manually download the source code from the url https://github.com/foglienimatteo/GaPSE.jl (Code > Download Zip)

- go inside the directory of GaPSE (`$ cd GaPSE.jl` in the shell) 

Inside the directory, there is a file called `install_gapse.jl`, which is a Julia script conceived for downloading and installing all the dependencies of GaPSE. You can run it by typing in the terminal:

```bash
     $ julia install_gapse.jl
```
If there are no error messages at the end of the installations, than GaPSE is corretly configured and you can start to use it!
  
NOTE: the packages that this script will install are the ones strictly required for GaPSE. The ipynbs we provide need however some more, as `Plots`, `LaTeXStrings` and `PyPlot` (which in turn requires a python kernel with `Matplotlib` installed); in case you don't have them, run with a terminal in this directory:
```bash
$ pip3 install matplotlib
$ julia --activate=. --eval 'using Pkg; for p in ["Plots", "LaTeXStrings", "PyPlot"]; Pkg.add(p); end; Pkg.resolve()'
```

NOTE: instead of using the `install_gapse.jl` script, you can also do the same in a more interactive way, if you prefer:

- open a Julia REPL session and activate the project; you can achieve that opening the REPL with 
  ```bash
  $ julia --activate=.
  ```
  or directy inside the REPL entering the Pkg mode (`]`) and running `activate .`

- enter the Pkg mode (if you haven't done in the previous step) typing `]` and run `instantiate`; this command will automatically detect and install all the package dependecies (listed in `Project.toml`)

- done! You can exit from the package mode (press the Backspace key on an empty line) and start to use GaPSE


### traditional way: Usage

There are three ways in order to use this code:

- you can write whatever instruction inside the file `GaPSE-exe.jl` and then run in the command line
  ```bash
    $ julia GaPSE-exe.jl
  ```

- you can open a Julia REPL session, include the code with
  ```julia
     include("<path-to-GaPSE.jl-directory>/src/GaPSE.jl")
  ```
  and then use interactively the GaPSE functions

- you can run the same `include("<path-to-GaPSE.jl-directory>/src/GaPSE.jl")` command in a Jupyter Notebook, and use the code functions inside it. This is by far the most confortable way.

Some `.ipynb`s are already provided in the directory `ipynbs` :
- we encourage you to follow the `ipynbs/TUTORIAL.ipynb` file first. The basic structure of the code and the most important functions are there presented;
- `ipynbs/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.ipynb` explains the analytical Primordial Non-Gaussianities model we use here, compute its contribution in the redshift bin $1.0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ and compare it with the GNC effects, all using our toy-model window function with angular opening $\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/2$;
- `ipynbs/Generic_Window.ipynb` explains how to use GaPSE with a generic Window Function of your choice;
- `ipynbs/eBOSS_Window.ipynb` apply GaPSE on a real case scenario: the eBOSS window function;
- the `ipynbs/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.jl` Julia file its the translation into script of `ipynbs/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.ipynb`; you can easily run it from the command line with:
  ```bash
    $ julia Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.jl
  ```

The code is well tested and documented: almost each struct/function has a docstring that you can easily access in Julia with `?<name-of-the-struct/function>`, and there is an acitive GitHub Pages website with the [latest stable documentation](https://foglienimatteo.github.io/GaPSE/stable).

### Docker container: Installation and Usage

The `Dockerfile` we provide in this directory is the one we used to create the container image corresponding to this GaPSE version.

The images are saved in https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matteofoglieni/gapse/general and the tag is the same as the GaPSE version the container refers to + a latin letter (alphabetically orderer), to take into account different version of the Dockerfile which refer to the same GaPSE one.
The latest container name is then `gapse:0.8.0a`.

These containers have already installed all the Julia packages that GaPSE needs (i.e. the ones listed in `Project.toml`) + come others for the ipynbs (check the Dockerfile itself).

Supposing that you have already installed Docker, so as to use GaPSE as a container:
- download the image: 
  ```bash
  $ sudo docker pull matteofoglieni/gapse:0.8.0a
  ```
- choose a free port where to access the JupyterLab of the container; we will use `10000`;
- run the container with that port:
  ```bash
  $ sudo docker run -d -p 10000:8888 matteofoglieni/gapse:0.8.0a
  ```
- get the logs of the container and copy the Jupyter token (in the following output is `531vbeb08567581944e486d47e1tee15683757086205da68`):
  ```bash
  $ sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps -ql)
